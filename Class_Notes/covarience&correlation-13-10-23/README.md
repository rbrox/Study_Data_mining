Correlation and covariance are statistical measures used to determine the relationship between two variables. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, while covariance measures how much two variables change together. 

In redundancy removal or similarity detection, correlation and covariance can be useful in identifying patterns and relationships between data points. By analyzing the correlation and covariance between different variables, we can identify which variables are redundant or similar to each other. This can help us to remove redundant variables and simplify our data, or to identify similar data points and group them together. 

Overall, correlation and covariance are powerful tools for analyzing relationships between variables and identifying patterns in data.
